REBOL [
    Title: "Stress test for varying sizes of httpd payloads"
    Description: {
        This generates increasingly large strings to serve (doubling the length
        on each successive call).  The client checks to make sure the right
        number of bytes and the right contents come back.

        If `hangup` is specified as an argument to the script, then it will
        try to confuse the server by disconnecting from it every other time...
        and see if it can continue to serve data as expected despite that.
    }

    ; To get some variance in when a hangup occurs (early or late in a transfer)

    ; test new hangup points, while still being reproducible.
